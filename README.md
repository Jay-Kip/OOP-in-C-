Practice on OOP in C++

Class - A blueprint of an object
Instance - Occurence of an object
Attribute- Characteristics of an object
Method/ Functions - Operations performed on an object

Access Modifiers:
    (i) Public - Can be accessed from anywhere (inside and outside the class)
    (ii) Private - Can only be accessed from inside the class
    (iii) Protected - Lie in between public and private

Constructor - Special function that is automatically called when an object of that class is called

    Constructors should:
(i) Doesn't have return type
(ii) Has same name as the class it belongs to
(iii) Must be public
